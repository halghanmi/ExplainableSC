# ExplainableSC - ExplanaSC Framework

This repository documents the construction of the ExplanaSC framework, taxonomy of smart contract decisions from literature reviews, the results of framework evaluations, and the practical application demonstrated through example use cases. The primary purpose of ExplanaSC is to support requirements engineers in defining essential information requirements for the creation of explainable smart contracts (XSC).


### The repository includes:


#### 1- Framework Iterative Processes and SC Decisions Taxonomy File: 
- Blockchain and smart contract architecture.
- Lists of resources utilised in the decision taxonomy and the final table of grouping concepts.
- The three iterations of framework construction.
- The final framework iteration with example applications.

#### 2- Framework Evaluation Strategies and Results File: 
- Experts survey questions and answers.
- Explanation of the example use case application and the strategies employed.
- The proposed example scenarios with the corresponding smart contract code filename.

#### 3- Contracts Folder: 
- Smart contracts for the three proposed scenarios before defining informational requirements.
- Smart contracts with implemented informatioal requirements defined using ExplanaSC framework.
