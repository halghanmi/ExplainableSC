# Smart Contract Assessment Approach

This repository contains an approach for assessing the security of smart contracts. The assessment approach involves the use of various security analysis tools, a systematic selection process, and the mapping of design vulnerabilities to Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs).

## Assessment_Approach Folder

The `Assessment_Approach` folder includes:

### Aggregated Vulnerabilities

A collection of aggregated vulnerabilities identified during the assessment process.

### 53 Security Analysis Tools

A comprehensive list of 53 security analysis tools utilized in the assessment.

### Systematic Selection of 9 Automated Analysis Tools

Details on the systematic selection of 9 automated analysis tools from the larger set.

### Mapping Design Vulnerabilities to CWEs

Documentation on how design vulnerabilities are mapped to Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs).

## Dataset Folder

The `Dataset` folder includes:

### 16 Vulnerable Smart Contracts

A set of 16 vulnerable smart contracts used for testing and assessment purposes.

## Automated_Analysis_Results Folder

The `Automated_Analysis_Results` folder includes:

Results of running the selected 9 security analysis tools on the provided dataset.

## Experimental_Results Folder

The `Experimental_Results` folder includes detailed results from the identification and estimation steps of the assessment approach.

### Identification Steps Results

Detailed results and findings from the identification steps of the assessment.

### Estimation Steps Results

Detailed results and findings from the estimation steps of the assessment.

## Usage

Provide instructions on how to use the Smart Contract Assessment Approach, including how to reproduce the analysis and interpret the results.

## Contributing
